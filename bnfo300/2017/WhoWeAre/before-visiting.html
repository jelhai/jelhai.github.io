<P>No problem is too small to warrant our attention, and no problem is so large that it cannot be solved, somehow. 

<P><B><I>However</I></B>, don't expect magic wands. There aren't any.
Requests for help that begin and end with "I'm sooooooo confused!" are likely to elicit nothing more than "I'm so sorry to hear that." 

<P>Successful consultations will begin with your setting forth the problem you're confronting, the steps you have taken to overcome it, and what you feel you need to make further progress. You're responsible for the success of the consultation.

<P>Here are some steps to create a request for help that might be effectively answered:

<OL>
<LI><B><U>General frame</U></B>
<BR>Describe the overall area in which your problem lies. Don't rely on me to remember anything.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI><B><U>Specific frame</U></B>
<BR>Describe the part of the overall area that is giving you problems. Again, don't rely on me to remember anything.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI><B><U>Specific example</U></B>
<BR>Describe at least one instance of what you actually did that caused you to believe you have a problem. Explain how the result you got is deficient.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI><B><U>Attempts to resolve the problem</U></B>
<BR>Describe different ways you attempted to overcome the problem.
<BR>&nbsp;


<LI><B><U>Rant</U></B> (optional)
<BR>Here's your chance to vent, but be specific. Exactly what is causing your frustration?
<BR>&nbsp;


<LI><B><U>Specific request</U></B>
<BR>Tell me in specific terms what you hope I can do for you.
<BR>&nbsp;

</OL>

<P>If you think a problem is not fair because it doesn't give you enough information to answer it, a good strategy is to write me an e-mail setting forth why the problem is impossible. Make sure you cover every possible avenue of attack, so that I have no choice but to admit that I was an idiot. If you do this, either you will (9 times out of 10) realize midway through that you forgot a loophole you can wriggle through or (the tenth time) have a solid complaint to send out.
