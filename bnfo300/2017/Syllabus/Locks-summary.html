Forest Bear<br>

<p><font size="+1">Bears are generally reclusive creatures with
no significant contact with human beings. As a result, we know
little about their daily routines and habitat. In particular,
information is scanty regarding ursal food preferences and factors
influencing the choice of furniture found in bear dens. The author
attempted in situ measurements under natural conditions in order
to gain insight into the life of the forest bear.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Three parameters of daily life of the forest
bear were selected for close scrutiny: food temperature, sites
chosen by bears for relaxation, and the relationship between body
mass and hibernation sites. The temperature of freshly prepared
breakfast material was assayed qualitatively by probing samples
with a moist tongue. Compressibilities of resting surfaces were
assessed as the degree of distension when subjected
to the weight of the experimenter. Chair sizes were also noted.
All measurements were taken in triplicate.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Interestingly, all three kinds of measurements
gave wide ranges of values. Porridge temperatures ranged from
too cold to too hot, seats from too tall to too short, and beds
from too hard to too soft. Technical problems hampered efforts
to obtain definitive data. For example, critical measurements
on seat distensibility had to be discarded because a chair broke
during the course of the experiment. In fact, the entire project
had to be abandoned during the final measurements when the sudden
return of the bears to their lair greatly increased the likelihood
of experimenter error.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Despite the technical difficulties in performing
these experiments, certain general conclusions are possible. Bears,
as judged by their artifacts, are quite polymorphic: some large,
some small, and some in between. If one can extrapolate from a
limited sample, even kin groups tend towards heterogeneity of
morphic types. The causal relationship, if any, between ursal
size and lifestyle awaits the possibility of controlled experiments</font>.
