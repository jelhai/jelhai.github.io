<p><A name="What"></A><b><I>What are exams?</I></b>

<p>You might think that this question
is rather unnecessary -- you've taken a few exams in your time. But you may find exams in this course to be a different sort. You need to understand that in my view we have exams primarily because they're one of the best teaching tools in existence. The evaluation function is strictly secondary. Exams may be the time when you put things together for the
first time. It may be the first time you really go out on a solo flight.
It is likely to be the time when you put in your most concentrated effort. Exams focus the mind. 

<P>To function as a teaching tool, exams need time. The exams will give you time -- a full week. You may during this period consult with me or the TAs, and for the 2nd and 3rd exam, we will schedule a meeting during which you will have the opportunity to discuss with me as much as you care to any difficulties you may encounter. 

<p>If exams are so good at teaching, then I'd better be careful what lessons 
are taught. As best as I can manage, the take-home exams will pose problems similar to 
those you will face in the real world. With that in mind, all exams will 
be open book, open web, open everything
except living people (exception: you can always go to me or the TA with a question).
<B><I>But don't fall into the trap of relying 
on the book to save you.</I></B> If you do, I predict with some measure of 
confidence that <B><I>you will be screwed to the wall!</I></B> 
(Besides, there is no book)
<HR>

<p><A name="content"></A><b><I>What will be on the exams?</I></b>

<p>Questions will be inspired by the investigations, study questions, 
and problem sets you get for each unit. A question may be very close to
one in a problem set, with only the details changed, or it may combine
salient features from a study question with a question in a problem set.
And so forth.
<HR>

<p><A name="collaborative"></A><b><I>Are exams collaborative, like problem sets?</I></b>

<P>Exams differ from problem sets with respect to collaboration. With problem sets, you are encouraged to
work with others, although the work you eventually hand in should be the product of your own (possibly improved)
mind. Exams, on the other hand, give you an opportunity to work on your own. However, it is entirely natural --
indeed, expected -- that you should interact with me or a TA during the course of the exam. The prime
directive: If you're stuck, don't stay stuck!
<HR>

<p><A name="do-well"></A><b><I>How can I do well on exams?</I></b>

<p>Do well on the problem sets.
