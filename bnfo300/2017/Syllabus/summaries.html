<p>One or two times over this semester you will be asked to write a 
summary of one experiment from one research article. At first, this
will not be an easy task -- far from it!

<p><B><I>Then why do it?</I></B> 

<P>Research articles are the primary source of <A href="../Units/Intro-course/why-find-research-articles.html" target="_blank">scientific truth</A>. Not textbooks. Not the New York Times. Not a Nobel prize winner talking on the Today Show.

<P>Unfortunately, they are exhausting to read,... if you're intent is to understand
everything they contain. On the other hand, the task becomes easier if you
learn how to extract <B><I>just what you need</I></B> from an article to 
answer your specific question. What you need is a result that addresses 
your question and an understanding of how that result was obtained. Without
the result, you have just a claim with no basis. Without the method, you
have no limit on the reach of the result. Without any of that you have no 
<B><I>measure of truth</I></B>, except the reputation of the author. (You may say that relying on reputation is how the world often works, but that's sure not science!)

<P>Writing summaries trains you to read articles in this way, to focus on 
what you need. Each summary you write makes the next one easier, until you 
are able to write summaries in your head as you read the article. In short,
learning how to <B><I>write</B></I> a focused summary is learning how to <B><I>read</B></I> a research
article.

<P>Finally, writing a summary of an experiment from a well-chosen research 
article is excellent preparation for your research project. It may serve as
the vehicle by which you understand the area you chose to study and how to 
approach your subject. If you choose the article well, parts of your summary may serve as a central piece of the Introduction to your proposal.

<P>There is advice available on <A href="../Units/Intro-course/how-to-write-summaries.html"
