<p><A name="What"></A><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>What are problem sets?</font></font></b>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>This course is built around solving
problems (see <i><a href="objectives.html" target="_blank">Objectives</a></i> for the rationale
behind this choice). Research projects are one way to get you into 
problem-solving mode, but another way is to supply you with a stream 
of bite-sized problems found in <B><I>Problem Sets</I></B>. Some problems will
be relatively straight-forward others totally obscure.  

<P>Why obscure? As best I can, I'll offer problems that put the concepts we are talking about within a 
context where they actually arise in real life, and life generally isn't
very helpful. In many cases you will find that the biggest difficulty isn't 
finding a solution to a problem but rather figuring out what the 
problem is all about. That's usually the case in real life. 
Once you grasp the question, the solution sometimes almost
takes care of itself. This sort of question can certainly be more frustrating than 
drill-type questions, but hey -- that's science! The greater part
of science is not finding the answer to a question but <A href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/22/solve/" target="_blank">finding the
right question to ask</A>. And not only science -- no matter what you're
doing in 10 years, it will probably involve problem solving. It's not
likely to involve taking multiple choice or drill-type exams.

<P>But never mind generalities, <A href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~elhaij/bnfo300/14/Units/Protein/PS3-protein.pdf" 
target="_blank">here</A>'s 
a link to a problem set that might give you the idea.

<HR>

<p><A name="How-to-answer"></A><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>What do I do when I have no 
idea how to answer a problem?</font></font></b>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>You might find this to be a common
occurence (just as it is in real life). First of all, don't panic! This 
is normal. This is life. Learn to welcome confusion as an old friend. When 
you remain unsure of your moorings, that is when anything is possible. 
Like complaining muscles during exercise, a complaining brain -- <I>I'm confused!</I>
-- is <B><I>good</I></B>! (and 
<A href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771.long" target="_blank">
others</A> have said the same thing). 
Revel in that brief freedom! Relax and let the problem tell its story.
</font></font>

<P><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>The true enemy is not confusion but 
despair. If you find despair beginning to eat at you, avail yourself of one 
of the many <A href="../WhoWeAre/index.html" target="_blank">sources of help</A>: from your 
colleagues, from the TA, or from me.</font></font>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Second, reflect on what you need
to know in order to answer the problem. Seek a connection like, "the problem 
would be easy if I only knew how many bilirumps there are in a frazzle." 
Then your task reduces to the usually simple matter of finding the requisite 
fact. If you determine that the 
difficulty lies in a specific hole in your molecular education (e.g. "<I>What
in the world is a southwestern blot???</I>), visit your friend, Google, or seek 
<A href="../WhoWeAre/index.html" target="_blank">help</A> -- perhaps someone 
in the class has already gone down this road. But the <u>first</u> step is to
pin down exactly what you need to know so that you can go to the web or
possibly helpful colleagues or me with a question that might be recognizable.

<P><B><I>Don't</I></B> throw yourself prostrate in front of the proposed 
helper and whimper "<I>Help me! Please, help!</I>" Learning is most 
effective when <B><I>you</I></B> direct the learning process. Figure out
what questions you need to ask before you ask for help. <A href="../WhoWeAre/before-visiting.html" target="_blank">Here</A>'s some advice on how to prepare for calling on others.
</font></font>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Perhaps you feel that there is not
enough information available to answer the question. That's a start! In
that case, try writing out an unassailable proof that the question cannot
be answered. Cast it in the form of a letter to whoever wrote the question 
("<I>Dear Idiot,...</I>"). Often in doing so, you find a hole in your argument, a hole
through which you can escape and answer the question (I've written hundreds of
Dear Idiot letters, never sent). And, like a worm
on a hook, keep wiggling. The more you try new twists, the greater the 
chance that you find a way to work yourself loose. But if you reach the 
end of the letter and the proof is still sound,... send it.</font></font>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Finally, we will devote considerable
time in class to problems. This requires, however, that you bring with
you the issues to be discussed. We can't jump over any hurdles until you
have encountered them.</font></font>

<P>Feel free,... no, invited,... no, URGED to attack the problem sets 
with your colleagues. However, so that feedback is meaningful, hand in
the product of your own mind, in your own words.

<HR>

<p><A name="Graded"></A><b><font size=+1>Will problem sets be graded?</font></b>

<p><font size=+1>No. But you may turn them in to receive feedback. This
service is offered up to the published target date (and beyond, if the TA is willing). This
policy is intended to encourage you to do problem sets as they are dispensed
(to avoid unsightly buildup at certain times during the semester) and also
to protect us on the receiving end from gluts of more work than we can handle.</font>

<p><b><font size=+1>Then why should I... I mean they're not going to be
graded, right? So...</font></b>

<p><font size=+1>Who am I to tell you the best way to master your craft?
In MY experience, however, concepts aren't really learned unless I can
USE them in their actual contexts, i.e. by solving problems. With that
in mind, all <a href="exams.html">exams</a> will be based on problems.
And, since I am not infinitely creative, I will generally take the questions on the
exams from the problem sets we've already handed out, with minimal modification.

<P>In fact, I'll come out right now with a fairly bold claim: Just about everything 
on every exam will be a visibly apparent variation on some question from a 
problem set (or investigation or study question).
