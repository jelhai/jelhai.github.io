<p>You can't really understand an experiment until you do it yourself. 
And without an understanding of the experiment, you can't really understand 
the limitations of the results:
What are the likely sources and magnitude of error? How dependent is the 
experiment on the experimental system? WIthout addressing these questions, you can't 
really understand the implications of the results. Unfortunately, you 
can seldom run to the lab and perform the experiment 
you just read about, even if you have a lab well equiped with the tools of molecular
biology. 

<P>But bioinformatics is different. Experiments that rely on computation and 
digital data (a greatly increasing number of biological experiments) can often be
replicated by anyone with a computer and the will to do so. I can't tell you 
how many times I've stared dimly at an article until I powered up the computer
and did the experiment myself. Then the lights flashed.

<P>We're focusing on molecular biology this semester, not bioinformatics.
Nonetheless, I will make every attempt to give you the opportunity to perform 
(in some sense) the experiments you read about. Sometimes the experiment can
be simulated on the computer. Other times it is possible to at least analyze the
data. Expect, one way or another, to do what you read, as much as possible.

<P>Some simulations will be done within an integrated molecular biology/programming 
environment called BioBIKE. There's no need for you to learn how to program -- this
semester (but wait until next...). I'll be doing almost all the programming myself necessary
to make the simulations work. 

<P>However, if you want to read more about what BioBIKE is all about and how it works, here are some links:
