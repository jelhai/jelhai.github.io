<p><A name="lectures"></A><font color="#000000"><font size=+1><B>What about lectures?</B>
<BR>I can't remember a single lecture I heard in college. 
But I do remember <B><I>doing</I></B> things and can see now 
what I gained by having done them. True, lectures may sometimes 
have inspirational or entertainment value, but rarely in my opinion, 
and I'm not up to playing Billy Graham or Jerry Seinfeld two matinee's 
per week. I'd rather focus on the science. Furthermore, if the goal is 
active knowledge, then passive listening to lectures is not the way to
go [<A href="#ref1">1</A>,<A href="#ref2">2</A>]. So...

<p>...there won't be regular lectures. Instead, I'll spend that time 
(and more) trying to build environments where you can learn by doing 
and providing guidance specific to your needs. To that end, lecture 
material will be put on the web as notes as often as I can manage 
it. If you see me giving a lecture, you may reasonably suspect that 
I ran out of time and had to take the easy way out. Complain to a VCU 
administrator that you're not getting your money's worth.  

<P><B>Read <U>before</U> coming to class</B>
<BR>I ask you to go over the 
notes (and <A href="reading-research-articles.html" target=_blank">articles plus companions</A>) 
<I><B>in advance of the class for which they were prepared</B></I>, 
then to let me know what areas you need more help on. In that way, 
I can arrange class so that it focuses on the areas that are most 
helpful to you. Study questions are embedded into the notes so that 
you don't go completely into passive mode. 
<A href="../Units/Protein/protein.pdf" target=_blank">Here</A>'s an example of notes.

<P>Yes, it is easier to understand what you read if I feed it to you beforehand, but then you're stuck knowing only what I fed. What happens when the spoon is gone? <B><I>In general, I will not discuss material in class unless you ask me to</I></B> (but then I will be delighted to do so).
<HR>

<p><A name="discussions"></A><B>Discussions, based on what you need</B>
<BR>In order to tailor the class to your needs, I ask for continuous feedback from you. I do this through questionnaires that accompany each day's notes. The purpose of these questionnaires is
to identify the problem areas -- the study questions that stump you, the concepts that remain fuzzy. They are not graded (except in the sense that life grades you for every choice you make). Questionnaires are also a means you can use to tell me particular concerns you are having with any aspect of the course. There will always be a general question at the end soliciting your comments that don't fit elsewhere. Doing questionnaires may have some therepeutic value, but so that they have value to <B><I>me</I></B> (and my preparations for class), I ask you to send them in <I><B>by 6 am on the day of class</B></I> (<U>earlier even better</U>!).

<P>To summarize, don't sit back and expect me to <B><I>teach</I></B> 
you anything in class. Very little I can teach is worth learning. 
Anything of long lasting value you have to <B><I>learn yourself</I></B> 
through your own motivation. If there's nothing you need help with, fine, 
we will have very short classes. You're the one paying the bills.
<HR>

<p><A name="cant-read"></A><B><I>What should I do if I can't read the notes before class?</I></B>
<BR>Well, such things happen on occasion. I will focus on questions 
from people who <B><I>have</I></B> read them, so you may well 
feel lost. Maybe you'll still gain something, I don't know. That's OK. 
But if you find that you often don't have time to read the 
notes before class, you might ask yourself if you have time to take 
this course.
