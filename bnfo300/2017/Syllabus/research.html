By the end of the semester you will have written and defended a proposal
to perform an experiment that you believe will extend our knowledge in a 
significant way of how something works at the molecular level. It will present a phenomenon worthy of our attention and
argue that we could make headway in understanding that phenomenon if
we knew the answer to a specific bite-sized question (clearly stated) 
amenable to experiment with the
currently available tools of molecular biology. Then you will proceed to
explain the workings of that experiment, what results you might obtain 
(not just the result you want), and what are the implications of those
possible results. 

<P>All of this will occur within several pages.

<P>It is important to understand that there is no expectation that the experiment you 
propose will actually be performed. If you and your mentor strike up an association
and you end up working in a lab -- wonderful! -- but that lies outside the scope of
this course. Most will complete the proposal without ever having set foot in a lab.

<HR>
<p><A name="Why"></A><b><I>Research proposal... Why is it?</I></b><BR>
Last year many of you (those in phage lab) joined in on a project to understand the variation in 
phage genomes. You were given the tools and had ample direction
concerning their use. Still there was some room for creativity. In future bioinformatics courses (viz., <A href="http://bernicehuang.com/pages/bnfo301.html" target="_blank">BNFO301: Intro to Bioinformatics</A> and BNFO420: Applications in Bioinformatics) will conceive and perform a project with bioinformatic content. This semester 
you are offered the prospect of something in between: freedom in conceiving
the project but carrying no obligation to do it.

<P>...but for what? There is a broad consensus that learning is deeper and more persistent 
when it is done with the whole mind engaged, through active inquiry. Here are reports from
two panels that drew the conclusion that the research should be a routine part of the undergraduate experience:

<P>That's research. A research <B><I>proposal</I></B> has an additional benefit. Every February
there's a competition amongst undergraduates for stipends given out by 
<A href="http://www.research.vcu.edu/ugresources/fellowship-instructions.htm" target="_blank">VCU</A> and a 
separate competition for stipends from the Center for the Study of Biological Complexity. In
both cases, undergradutes are asked to submit a proposal concerning the research they hope
to do. You will have a proposal ready to go, critiqued and polished, should you wish to try for a stipend.

<P>Even if you don't, you will have gotten a glimpse as to what you <B><I>could</I></B> do
should you turn your hand to research during your time at VCU.

Here's a link to an article -- one inspiration for this course -- that describes the benefits 
of research proposals within a course on molecular biology:

<HR>
<p><A name="Topic"></A><b><I>Research proposal... What topic?</I></b><BR>

Research is not done in a vacuum. You may have a wonderful idea for a new energy source for
interstellar space travel, but if you're the only person who has ever thought about quantum
self-annihilation, the chances of doing the crucial experiments are remote. In real life, you 
extend the boundary of what is known by just a bit, in an environment where others are
exerting themselves in similar directions, in a group where science is a social activity. This way, you have available the necessary 
equipment, intellectual support, and experience to make a go of it. Never mind the movies, this is how successful science is done.

<P>With that in mind, you will choose a topic related to molecular biology that lies within the sphere of a VCU faculty member, 
so that this faculty member can serve as a mentor during the process of conceiving and writing the proposal
(and perhaps later, if you should choose to actually do the experiment). As preparation,
you will be asked early in the semester to compose an annotated list of articles focused on some research area of
interest to a VCU faculty member.

<P>Click <A href="..Units/Proposal/How-to-find-a-mentor.html" target="_blank">here</A> 
to learn more of the process of finding a mentor and <A href="../Units/Proposal/main.html" target="_blank">here</A> 
to learn more of the process of writing the proposal.

<HR>
<p><A name="Path"></A><b><I>Research proposal... How to get there?</I></b><BR>
Even though the proposal itself will run about 8 minutes (oral presentation) and a handful of pages (written proposal), there is no doubt that you will need a semester-long, major sustained effort to reach a successful conclusion. 
There will be several intermediary points along the way to help you find your way. Finding a mentor and 
learning how questions are addressed in your mentor's lab will be an important first step. You will also 
summarize one or more experiments from research articles related to your chosen question, as preparation
for your proposal. You will also report on your progress at intermediate stages and give a presentation prior to the final presentation. 
Click <A href="../Units/Proposal/main.html" target="_blank">here</A> to learn more about the time course 
leading to the final proposal.

<HR>
<p><A name="Outcome"></A><b><I>Research proposal... What will happen to it?</I></b><BR>
Your proposal will be poked at by a panel of your colleagues, in the roles of proposal reviewers, and 
from the comments from the panel you might learn which logical connections that seemed so clear
to you are not clear to others. At the end of the semester, a revised version of the proposal will be submitted to a panel 
consisting of members of VCU's research community, who will have the opportunity to <A href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=28" target="_blank">question you</A> on aspects of your proposal.

<P>It will be a lot of fun.
