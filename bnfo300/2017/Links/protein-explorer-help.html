<b><font size=+2>Protein Explorer</font></b> is a resource that enables you to visualize
proteins in three-dimensions and provides tools that help you focus on different features
within the protein. It has great capabilities, but most of them require you to interact with 
it through a specialized language. The language is simple, but even so, if you want a 
menu-driven interface, you might prefer
<A href="http://firstglance.jmol.org/">FirstGlance</A>,
at the expense of some capabilities.

<P>There is a lot of online help available through Protein Explorer. The purpose of this 
web page is to help you find that help and figure out which brand is what you need.

Going to <A href="http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/pe/protexpl/htm/index.htm" target="_blank">Protein Explorer</A>
gets you to the following page:

Your ticket inside is a four-character PDB (Protein DataBase) code. If you know the protein you want but don't know its PDB code, you might be able to find it by searching the 
<A href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/" target="_blank">Protein Data Base</A>.

<P>
<TABLE border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<TR><TD><font size=+1>After you enter the PDB code, you'll be brought to the First View screen. There's little you can 
do here that you can't do on the more powerful Quick View screen. Go there by clicking 'Quick'.

</TABLE>

<P>The Quick View screen allows you to do some things easily, using the preset interface at the top of the page. If you play with it, you'll be amazed at its abilities. Some things, however, require the flexibility offered by the command box at the bottom of the page. But what commands to use? The help pages described in the next section may be of some help.

RasMol is one of the two languages that drive Protein Explorer. Its manual is gigantic. 
There's a reasonable chance that what you're looking for is there, somewhere.

Commands in Jmol and Rasmol</a><BR>
Jmol is the other language that drives Protein Explorer. The most common commands you'll use are those
that select certain parts of the structure (e.g. specific chains or certain amino acids). This help
page focuses on those commands.
