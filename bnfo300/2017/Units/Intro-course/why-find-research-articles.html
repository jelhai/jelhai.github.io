<P>"<I>Study after study has confirmed that there is no evidence eating genetically modified foods... is in any way harmful...</I>"
<BR> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Center for Accountability in Science. Genetically Modified Foods (GMOs): <A href="https://www.accountablescience.com/?post_type=research&p=17" target="_blank">Are genetically modified foods really dangerous?</A>

<P>"<I>There is no credible evidence that GMO foods are safe to eat...</I>"

<P>People yell and scream at each other, pointing out unsavory motives. If this were a debate as to whether 
Star Wars is better than Star Trek, OK, fine. But somewhere in this discussion is -- or should be -- observations about the natural world, emperical truths, 
things that can measured. Emperical truths are things that mortal political enemies should be able to agree on. 
Granted, the future is not an emperical truth, and how to prepare for the future is a political decision, not a scientific one, but observations surely provide the most effective basis for such preparations. 

<P>If rants remain the general level of discourse, then we're probably doomed. 

<P>How do you find out what is true? I submit that what is verifiably true is not to be found in either 
The National Review or the Huffington Post. There you'll find interpretations, conclusions, and of 
course rants. Not the truth. Not the raw observation shorn of interpretation.

<p>I presume that you are already quite familiar with finding information through the internet -- 
Google, Wikipedia, etc -- and there's nothing wrong with these resources. I use them many times 
a day. But they only get you so far. In general, you get a synopsis of what is some people think is known, as you would 
from a mini-textbook. The overview is a good starting place, but don't mistake it for the truth. 
At their best, web pages give you links to research articles from which you can understand the limitations 
of the generalization that appear on the pages. Wikipedia is sometimes good at doing this 
(here's an <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" target="_blank">example</A>). Usually, however, you just get bald, unsupported 
statements (here's an <A href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/dna" target="_blank">example</A>). It really doesn't 
matter who wrote the bald statement (the previous example is on the National Institutes of Health web 
page), they're still bald.

<P>One thing you'll learn from your first tour, <A href="http://biobike.csbc.vcu.edu/examples/genes-tutorial.html" target="_blank">What is a Gene</A>, is that text books and web pages are 
quite limited. There's no replacement for doing experiments or reading about the experiments done by 
others. In general, you will need to be satisfied with the latter: how do you find accounts of 
experiments? Some of you have read research articles, and some have not. Of those who have, some have 
found the articles themselves, and some have had the articles 
given to them. For the latter, the days when people give you useful articles to read will soon be 
over, and if you don't know how to find scientific information on your own, you'll soon be helpless, 
victim to whatever anyone wants to feed you on the web.

<P>This must not be allowed to happen. You need to learn how to find 
research articles on your own.

<P>It doesn't matter that you may never do bioinformatics again.
<BR>It doesn't matter that you may spend the rest of your days 
selling handkerchiefs at Target.
<BR>Even so, you got to know this. You got to be able to find truth when you need it.
