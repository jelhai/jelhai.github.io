<P><B><A NAME="what is"></A>What is a research article?</B>

<P>Before we talk about how to find research articles, we have to agree on what we're looking for. 
We're looking for scientific truth. Where do you get it? From a Trustworthy Authority? Give me a break! (see 
<A href="trustworthy-authority.html" target="_blank">rant</A>).

<P>Scientific truth resides in research articles. A research article is one that provides <B><I>observations</I></B> or the observed <B><I>results</I></B> of experiments (not merely conclusions) and a description of <B><I>how the 
experiments were performed</I></B>, in sufficient detail that someone else might replicate them. You will 
recognize them by the detail paid to the methods on which the results were based.

<P>A news report of a scientific finding is not a research article. It doesn't describe how to do the experiment. 
A <A href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/lsl/help/modules/review.html" target="_blank">review article</A> is not a research article.
It combines lessons learned from multiple research articles but, again, does not describe how to do the experiments it covers.

<P><B><A NAME="strategies"></A>Strategies to find research articles</B>

<P>If you know the exact title of the article you're looking for, then:

<UL>
<LI><U>Your favorite search engine</U> may be the fastest way to reach the article (<B><I>if you have its exact title</B></I>). However, if you're doing this from off-campus, the site you reach will not recognize your IP address and not realize that you are a member of the VCU community and thus deserving of the full text of articles in journals to which VCU subscribes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI><U>VCU library general search facility</U> is an excellent way of getting most articles. If you are accessing it from off campus, you'll be prompted for your eID and password if needed. But no database is perfect, and you may sometimes need to look elsewhere.
</UL>

If you <B><I>don't</I></B> know the exact title, then:

<UL>
<LI>Using a search engines is generally a poor strategy -- too low of a signal-to-noise ratio
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI><A href="http://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</A> is much better but I haven't used it enough to know how its database compares to others. 
Note that Google Scholar allows advanced searches by clicking the down arrow in the search box.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>For greater flexibility, try dedicated services, such as 
<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank">PubMed</A> and 
<A href="http://apps.webofknowledge.com/WOS_GeneralSearch_input.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&SID=1F6hugmIm2XbenfMpBe&preferencesSaved=" target="_blank">Web of Sciences</A>. 
</UL>

There are two major strategies to use these indexes to find research articles 
(plus one general fallback strategy):
<UL>
<LI><U>Keyword search</U>: Looks for articles whose titles, abstracts, or author lists contain a 
set of words that you supply. Used by all the sites. This is what you're already used to.<BR>&nbsp;

<LI><U>Citation search</U>: Looks for articles that include in their list of references 
an article you supply. This often finds articles difficult to find by keyword search. 
This strategy is used by Web of Sciences in addition to keyword search. 
<A href="http://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</A> also let's you do this. Find your favorite known article in Google Scholar and then click "Cited by..." immediately below the listing of the article<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>If all fails, <U>Try your friendly local reference librarian</U>: 
By <A href=" http://www.library.vcu.edu/research/askus/" target="_blank">web</A>, by phone (804-828-1111), by e-mail (<A href="mailto:jaarendt@vcu.edu">Julie Arendt</A>, Science/Engineering Research Librarian)
or in person. This is their job, and they do it well. 
</UL>

<P>And here are some alternate strategies:
<UL>
<LI><U>Review articles</U>: 
<A href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/lsl/help/modules/review.html" target="_blank">Find a good one in your area of interest</A>
and plunder the reference list
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI><U>Related research article</U>: Find one that comes close, and use its reference list to identify an earlier,
related article
</UL>

<P><B><A NAME="advanced"></A>Advanced search interface</B>

<P>Most article search facilities offer a (slightly) more complicated interface that gives
you considerably more power. Using 
<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank">PubMed</A>, for example, clicking <TT>Advanced</TT> just under 
the main entry box brings you to an interface where you can:
<UL>
<LI><U>Browse before buying</U>: See the number of hits (by using the <TT>Add to History</TT> link) before commiting to displaying them on the screen.
<LI><U>Limit to title</U>: You can bias the search for articles in which a keyword is central to the article by demanding that the word is to appear specifically in the title, by using the down arrow next to 
      <TT>All fields</TT> and choosing <TT>Title</TT>.
<LI><U>Limit to article type</U>: Specify a particular kind of article, by using the down arrow next to <TT>All fields</TT>,
      choosing <TT>Publication type</TT>, then selecting on the desired type after clicking
      <TT>Show index list</TT>. This is most useful when looking for review articles (choose or type <TT>Title</TT>).
<LI><U>Limit to slice of history</U>: Specify a range of years when the desired article should have been published, by choosing
      <TT>Date-publication</TT> and filling in the date boxes that appear, making sure to adhere to PubMed's specified format (e.g. <TT>2000/01/01</TT> to <TT>2001/12/31</TT> to cover the years 2000-2001).
<LI><U>Limit to specific institution</U>: Specify a particular site where the work was done, by choosing <TT>Affiliation</TT> and
    either typing in the city or institution or choosing it from the <TT>Show index list</TT>
<LI><U>Use Boolean logic</U>: Combine the results of different searches or search terms using AND, OR, or NOT. Specify a search by its number (e.g. #3 for the results of the third search you performed, as listed in your <B>History</B>).
</UL>

See Pubmed <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3830/" target="_blank">help</A> and <A href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmed.html" target="_blank">quick tours</A> for details.

<P><B><A NAME="logistics"></A>Logistics of how to find full-text research articles</B>

<P>References are nice and abstracts sometimes helpful, but inevitably the time will come
when you need the actual article. However, many journals restrict access to those having 
subscriptions, so you want to make sure that the journals realize that you are at VCU (which 
has many subscriptions). You can do this either by using a computer on campus (your affiliation 
is recognized by your IP address) or by accessing the site from off campus through the VCU library. 
At some point, you'll be asked for your VCU eID and password. 
Here's one way to do it:
<UL>
<LI>From the <A href="http://www.library.vcu.edu/" target="_blank">VCU library web page</A>, click Databases.
<LI>Click P for Pubmed, W for Web of Science, or G for Google Scholar
<LI>Scroll down and click PubMed/MEDLINE (VCU), Web of Science (VCU), or Google Scholar (VCU). 
</UL>

If you like, you can bookmark the sites when you get there, but realize that your privileges 
will be sharply curtailed if you use the bookmarks from off campus. In that case, you need 
to go through the library as described.

<P>The library has a few useful apps to help you get through pay walls (at the bottom of its <A href="https://www.library.vcu.edu/research/tools/" target="_blank">tools & apps page</A>) without having to navigate through the library web page.
