<BR>I'm hoping to learn your thoughts when they're fresh on your mind after finishing the exam, 
<BR>but if you can't slog through a questionnaire right now, OK,  
<BR>then please promise to submit it within a few days.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>

Overall question: What have you learned thus far? Is it of importance to you? 
<BR>You might think about the following (and anything else that comes to your mind):
<UL>
<LI>Ability to define problems yourself, when the nature of the problem may not be immediately clear?
<LI>Ability to extract some use from a research article?
<LI>We've dabbled some in calculations, perhaps more so than in most biology courses. 
<BR>Your level of comfort? Sense any improvement?
<LI>Engagement with molecular biology, how biological things work at the molecular level?
<LI>What of importance do you anticipate you will learn in the remainder of the course?
<LI>Suggestions?

<b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>II. This semester - the
means</font></font></b>
<blockquote>
<U>Part 1: What means have been helpful in achieving useful ends?</U>
<P>You might consider the following (or anything else that comes to your mind):
<UL>
<LI>How to find articles (Exam 1; various articles throughout the semester)?
<LI>Problem sets and feedback?
<LI>Investigations (What is a Gene, building your own DNA, PCR simulation)?
<LI>Focus on results vs conclusion, including Mary Had a Little Lamb
<LI>Research proposal, including finding a mentor, interaction with mentor, 
     bibliography
<LI>Notes and companions
<LI>Other opportunities for feedback, including interaction with AKhil, Vince, and myself
</UL>
<textarea NAME="Means" ROWS="6" COLS="100"></textarea>

<P><U>Part 2: Use of class time</U>

<P>Here's the model for the course: 
<UL>
<LI>Complete the notes and study questions before class
<LI>Offer suggestions via a questionnaire
<LI>Discuss what needs to be discussed in class
<LI>Break up into groups to work on specific problems
</UL>
There's been a steady decline in your collective embrace of the first half of this model, leaving me to wonder what is the best use of class time. I am unwilling to return to the lecture, notes, regurgitate cycle. Lectures would be easier on all of us, but in my view, the easy-in, easy-out approach would have little value for you besides a mildly entertaining way (maybe) of passing the time before gaining a degree. So, what to do? Comments welcome.

<UL>
<LI>Have class discussions guided by questionnaires been useful to you?<BR>
<LI>Has working in groups in class been useful to you?
<LI>Do you feel you've had sufficient opportunity to influence the course according to your needs?
</UL>
<textarea NAME="Class" ROWS="6" COLS="100"></textarea>

<P><U>Part 3: Use of time outside of class</U>

<UL>
<LI>Has written feedback been useful? 
<LI>Face-to-face feedback? 
<LI>TA sessions?
<LI>Working with your colleagues outside of class?
<LI>Interaction with mentor?
</UL>
<textarea NAME="Outside" ROWS="6" COLS="100"></textarea>

<blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>
<UL>
<LI>How long did you spend on this exam? (use appropriate units and 
scientific notation if necessary)
<LI>How effective was the exam as a learning experience?
<LI>How would you characterize your sentiment now with respect to your recent
experience?<BR>
For example, you're cautiously satisfied with what you understand? Elated with your progress? Crushed, like so much oatmeal?
<LI>Do you feel that the exam deliver on its promise that it would be based on problem sets, tours, and study questions?
</UL>
<textarea NAME="Exam" ROWS="6" COLS="100"></textarea>
<P>Is there any exam question(s) in particular that you'd like to go over in class?

<b><font size=+1>IV. Time</font></b>

takes time. Have you been inclined to put in the time?

<LI>Looking back on the first part of this semester, characterize your sense of what you've accomplished.
