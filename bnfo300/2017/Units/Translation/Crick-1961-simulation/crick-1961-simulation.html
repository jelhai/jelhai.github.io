<font size="+1">
<br>In the late 1950's, the nature of the genetic code was highly in
doubt. By 1967, the function of the last of the 64 codons had been
identified [<a href="crick-1961-simulation-references.html" target="_blank">1</a>]. In between was a barrage of experimental work, the first published of which was a publication by Crick et al (1961) [<a href="crick-1961-simulation-references.html" target="_blank">2</a>]
that established the overall nature of the genetic code: Fixed length,
triplet or multiple of three, nonoverlapping, and probably highly
degenerate. You can read the account in its original [<a href="crick-1961-simulation-references.html" target="_blank">2</a>] as well as in a popular account of the work [<a href="crick-1961-simulation-references.html" target="_blank">3</a>].

</font></font></p><p><font size="+2"><font size="+1">While both of the
articles expended considerable energy discussing the groundbreaking
results and the second article provides insight into the principle
behind the experiment, neither one allows the reader to get a good feel
for how the experiments were conducted. Without such insight, the
experiments recede into the background, just so much magical
incantation necessary to produce the results.
</font></font></p><p><font size="+2"><font size="+1">The purpose of
the simulation described below is to provide you with the opportunity
to recreate the experiments whose results are presented in Crick et al
(1961). They are necessarily much compressed in time; however, they are
not compressed in complexity. Every step is represented.
