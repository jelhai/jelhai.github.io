<br>Both the MUTAGENIZE and CROSS functions ask that you specify how many phages are
used in the experiment. That's quite reasonable -- the more phages you mutagenize, the more mutants
you'll get, and the more phages you cross, the more progeny you get. The simulation needs
to know this number.

<P>And so do you. If you choose a number too small, you'll get zero plaques -- useless. If you choose
a number too large, you'll get so many plaques that they run together -- equally useless. In this simulation, 
you can cram no more than 1500 plaques on a plate before they run together.

<P>But there's much else you need to know in order to figure out how many phages to use in an experiment.

<P>If you're doing a <B>mutagenesis</B> experiment, you need to know that [<a href="crick-1961-simulation-references.html" target="_blank">6</a>]:
<UL>
<LI>The mutagenesis process kills off ~75% of the phage
<LI>Of those that survive, about 0.5% are R- mutants
<LI>Of the R- mutants, most are from mutations in either rIIA or rIIB (mostly rIIA)
<LI>For the purposes of this simulation, spontaneous mutation to R- doesn't happen
</UL>

<P>If you're doing a <B>cross</B>, you need to know that [<a href="crick-1961-simulation-references.html" target="_blank">8</a>]:
<UL>
<LI>The rate of recombination is proportional to the distance between the sites of interest
<LI>The rate of recombination between a site at the beginning of rIIA and a site at the end of rIIA is about 5%
<LI>rIIB is about half the size of rIIA
<LI><B>For the purposes of this simulation, the recombination rate has been deemed to be ten-times the natural rate!</B>
This is so to decrease the number of plaques you need to screen to get the desired constructs. I wanted to keep the simulation as 
close as possible to reality, but reality took many many months so forgive me this change.
