<p><font size=+1>At this point, you don't need to provide final responses to any question on the exam (except your definitive name). Rather, this is an opportunity for you to reflect on each question and assess what you need to answer it. If there is something you feel you need that you don't have in hand, now is the time to say so.
<P>I will respond to your needs as soon as I can.
