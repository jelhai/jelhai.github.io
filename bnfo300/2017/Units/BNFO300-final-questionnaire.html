<LI>
<U>The classroom experience</U>
<BR>Look back on the on-line notes (<A href="DNA/DNA-structure.pdf" target="_blank">example</A>), 
companions (<A href="Protein/Sanger-companion.pdf" target="_blank">example</A>), 
experiment simulations (<A href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~elhaij/bnfo301-08/Units/Intro-BioBIKE/VPL-alien-world/genetic-code.html" target="_blank">example</A>)
-- all done (in theory) outside of class, followed by discussions in class driven by responses to questionnaires (<A href="Translation/Translation-3-Q.html" target="_blank">example</A>). Consider:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>While I'm convinced that in theory this experience offers a far better strategy to attain the goals of the class than lecturing, in practice... well, it wasn't often put in practice. After spring break, 
class attendence was about a third of the total enrolled and the number of questionnaires submitted 
was less than a third of that. 
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>Evidently, most people judged that going to class was not the best use of their time, which, of course, is their legitimate choice to make. I could take the view that catering to the perceived needs of a third of the class is good enough and the remainder can live with the outcome of their decision. Part of that outcome is a very high rate of incompletes. Or I can take the view that something ought to be done to attract a larger fraction of the class, while keeping faithful to what I feel is worthwhile. It's easy to find ways to attract a large fraction (compulsary attendance is the easiest, but there are others), but at the same time to guide the class to something that's valuable in the long term? That's tough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>I would very much like a theory that <B><I>is</I></B> put into practice, class activities that
are so worthwhile that class <B><I>is</I></B> worthy of your time, and discovery simulations 
that actually promote discovery, because people actually engage in them and discover (or, failing that, some other route that achieves the course's goals). I wonder how
to get there. Attempt to compel these activities? That would work against one of the 
<A href="../Syllabus/objectives.html" target="_blank"><B><I>main</i></B> goals of the course</A>. Besides,
you should know better than I what is the best use of your time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<LI><U>Results vs conclusions</U>
<BR>The focus on primary research articles throughout the semester, supplemented by 
<A href="Intro-course/results-vs-conclusions.html" target="_blank">exercises in class</A>,
the <A href="../Syllabus/summaries.html" target="_blank">summary of an experiment</A>, 
the <A href="Proposal/main.html" target="_blank">research proposal</A>, and constant harping throughout the semester,
were all attempts to help you see the difference between results and conclusions and the importance of understanding the
experiment that led to a result. There were also many guides to help you develop strategies to cope with confusion, 
an inescapable part of science. ...And  not only science. What other defence is there against fake news except to demand the evidence?
<P>The research proposal will be considered in a moment, but besides that, your thoughts?<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;

<LI><U>The research project</U>
<BR>I saw this as an opportunity to view research as something more than science fairs, 
to see how questions are raised by prior experimental results, and -- most important -- 
to engage in a scientific dialogue with a mentor who sees science not as a classroom 
lecture but rather a lifelong calling. 
I tried to <A href="Proposal/main.html" target="_blank">spread the activity over the 
semester</A>, but for many this didn't appear to happen. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>What did you gain from the written research proposal and from the presentations?
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>What did you gain from the panel discussion of your proposal?
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>Few people mounted a sustained effort starting from January to the end of the semester (see the 
<A href="Proposal/main.html" target="_blank">time line</A>). Most relied on a burst of creative
activity during the last week or two.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>More than a few mentors commented on the scarcity of meetings suggested by their mentees.

<BR>&nbsp;

<LI><U>Help and feedback</U>
<BR>Most problem sets you turned in resulted in extensive feedback from either Elaina, Gus, or me. 
Elaina and Gus also had regular (and often extra) help sessions, offering a remarkable amount of their time. I met with you individually 
during each of the last two exams. There was also written feedback for the first two 
exams (but not the last), your summary of an experiment, and feedback related to your proposals and presentations. 
Some feedback came from your peers. There was also feedback during class. How did this work for you? Did you feel you had 
adequate opportunity to get the help and feedback you needed?
