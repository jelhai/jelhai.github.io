<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>You are probably here because you are not able to get a Java application to run. 
<BR>You may see complaints that your Java is out of date. 
<BR>You might see a black screen with an error message in the corner. 
<BR>If so, try the following:
<UL>
<LI><A href="https://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank">Update Java</A>
<LI>Go into your Java Control Panel (in Windows from the Windows Control Panel)
<LI>Go to the Security tab
<LI>Click Edit Site List
<LI>Click Add
<LI>Copy/type in the resulting blank box: http://www.umass.edu
<LI>Press OK
</UL>
